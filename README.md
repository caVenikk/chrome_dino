# Chrome Dino

This is a clone of the Chrome Dino (a. k. a. Dino Run, T-Rex Game) browser game with additional features on Python using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

The features are: Main menu, Scoreboard menu, Health bar, Bonuses (such as health bonus, time slow bonus and godmode bonus) and Ability to pause the game

- In the main menu you can enter your name, start the game, quit the game and go to the scoreboard menu
- The health bonus gives you 20 health points (sometimes 40, it's a bug) when you pick it up
- The time slow bonus slows the time (what else hehe c:)
- The godmode bonus gives you ability not to take damage for ~3 seconds
